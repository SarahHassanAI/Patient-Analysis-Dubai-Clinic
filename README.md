# Clinic Operational Efficiency: A Data-Driven EDA to Slash Wait Times & Boost Patient Satisfaction
## Executive Summary:
Patient satisfaction scores were **declining** at a Dubai clinic due to **long wait times**, risking patient churn and revenue. Using Python and Power BI, I identified bottlenecks in patient flow and developed a business action plan. 

The analysis reveals opportunities to **reduce average wait times from 22.1 to 15 minutes** and **increase patient satisfaction from 3.7 to 4.3 stars**, potentially protecting **AED 85,000+ in annual revenue**.

## The Business Problem:

Clinic stakeholders noticed **satisfaction scores were declining** (averaging 3.74 / 5) with 38.9% of patients experiencing **long waits over 25 minutes.** This is directly tied to clinic revenue and retention in **Dubai's competitive healthcare market**. 

How can we determine where bottlenecks are occurring in the patient journey, AND make adjustments to improve patient satisfaction?

## Methodology:
Applying my background in clinical and insurance operations, I:

1. Developed a **Python ETL pipeline** for automation (data cleaning & feature engineering)

2. Created a **Power BI dashboard** for real-time visibility into clinic operations (KPIs)

3. Performed statistical **modeling and bottleneck** **analysis** to spot pain points

   
##### _For this project scope, a CSV file was used. In a production environment, a direct database connection (e.g., SQL) would be the scalable best practice!_

## Skills:

Power BI: Dax, writing functions, ETL, calculated columns, data visualization, data modeling, KPI tracking

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Feature engineering, statistics

Business Intelligence: KPI development, metric tracking, dashboard creation, stakeholder reporting

## Results & Business Recommendation:
The analysis revealed that patients with long waits (>25 min) had significantly lower satisfaction scores (2.95 vs 4.61 for short waits). Pediatrics showed the longest average wait times (22.9 min) while afternoons were the busiest slots.
**Here’s how to fix it:**

**Immediate** Actions (0-3 Months):

   1. Assign additional support staff to Pediatrics during the high-volume afternoon slot.

   2. Roll out a time-management program for doctors with the highest wait times.

   3. Implement SMS wait time updates to manage patient expectations

Long-Term Initiatives **(6+ Months)**:

  1. **Develop a Predictive Staffing Model** using historical appointment patterns

  2. **Automate insurance verification and digital check-in** to reduce front-desk congestion

I believe these adjustments will target the largest satisfaction impact points & create a framework for continued operational excellence!


## Next Steps

 - A/B test digital check-in
 - Develop predictive staffing models
 - Train staff on new patient flow protocols
 - Measure satisfaction score impact monthly
